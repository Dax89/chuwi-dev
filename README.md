# Chipone Touch Screen

This repository contains a Chipone touch screen module, specifically for Chuwi vi10 and hi10 model lines.

Support has been added specifically for the CW1515 model.

This driver should be considered "complete, but unpolished". I do not have the CW1515 I was using to test this,
so I can't really do much in the way of further work on this driver.
